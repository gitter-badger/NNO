        <description>&lt;p&gt;How does enable more rational, coherent communication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a systems engineer I would tell you that the nodes of an effective communication network have to be receptive to the “signal” that other nodes are putting out, while filtering out the “noise” in the whatever carries the signal[s] that delivers the “signal” … you can get into all kinds of discussion when we talk about defining terms, eg what is meant by “effective” … can “effective” be quanitifiably, repeatably, reproducibly measured and compared by solid scientific metrics, what are those metrics?  And what do you mean by “solidly scientific?” It doesn’t matter … one enables rational, coherent and communicative by working to inprove these things and to optimizes ones resources for the improvement process by measuring performance and making adjustments to processes in a scientific fashion to quanitifiably measure performance of the improvement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are PATTERNS of success in the improvement of communication that inform how we might think about optimization in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNIX was designed to be a SMALL and USEFUL operating system and the people who used and developed UNIX had the experience to have a profound understanding of the reason for simplicity and the NEED for making everything transparent [without the MIND POLUTTION of a graphical user interface].  Unix was not designed from the ground up [like the way that products of Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other significantly proprietary products are] to to employ various mechanisms to lie, obfuscate and legally cheat users and to generally stop at nothing to keep the user from understanding the secret sauce of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING is a service.  Everything is TEMPORARY.  Products carry services, but often the product gets in the way of the consumer actually using the service they purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It&#39;s fun, but I wish that I knew what I was doing with Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My mentors are dead, anonymous guys who did huge things.  Someday I will be a dead anonymous guy. I don’t know if I have done huge things; I have done some things, encouraged and instigated bigger things in others … but I DESERVE to be anonymous. I don’t deserve to be a mentor; but I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although knowledgable people can still point to important guys an say something like “Look, that guy Feynman … man, what a genius!” … the sad truth that knowledgable, informed, intelligent people will have to admit [if they are reall all that intelligent] is that humans don’t matter that much in the grand scheme of things. God matters. Appreciating and contemplating your Creator is lot more important than your appreciation of anything else – except that you really have to get past the abstract appreciation of your Creator and get down and dirty and nasty and appreciate the others created by the same God … and you must appreciate them for what they are, on their terms, in the way that they would prefer to be appreciated in the same way that you would hope to be appreciated and respected by others … you don’t get to judge them – you are COMMANDED to love them as you love yourself [and that includes respecting and NOT judging their nasty choices and bad decisioins] … because you make bad choices that make you defensive about and cause you to contrive hideous rationalizations which nobody buys].&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to NNO.sh!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
